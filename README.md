**# Hackfest-25**
This repository contains the code for the Hackfest'25 hackathon by Team "TECH TITANS".

**Problem Statement :**

- Design and implement an AI-driven solution for GoFloww's Atom Mail platform to enable smart email composition, response generation, and content refinement based on user prompts.
- The solution should effectively analyze past email conversations to understand context, generate appropriate responses, and adapt to individual communication styles and preferences.
- Key challenges to address include ensuring user privacy, delivering a seamless user experience, maintaining the accuracy of AI-generated content, and handling diverse email contexts (formal, informal, technical, etc.).
- The ultimate objective is to significantly reduce the time spent on email management while maintaining or enhancing communication quality and user satisfaction.
